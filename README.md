# CS38003 - Python
## Problems and code for all CS380 assignments

### Lab 1

Lab1 has three programs is_better_deal.py, check_duplicates.py, check_pythagorean_triple.py. The first program finds the better deal between two options. The second program checks if there are duplicate numbers given three numbers. The third and final program checks if three numbers are a pythagorean triple.

### Lab 2

Lab2 has four programs get_total_score.py, encrypt.py, similarity_analysis.py, and dictionary_range.py. The first program gets the total score of a team, and returns -1 if the team plays itself. The second program encrypts text by modifying the ASCII values of each character of the text. The third program counts multiple occurrences of a word in the first and second paragraph. The fourth program finds the range of a dictionary, given a list of dictionaries.
